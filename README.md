# EthernityChain Testnet Ultimate Guide
Made some few modifications to the original code to ensure you don't catch an error... you can check out files in this repo to verify :)

- Ensure you bridge from Sepolia to Ethernity Chain Using SuperBridge or Brid.gg before proceeding with the guide

  **Let's get Started :)**

  <h2>Smart Contract Deployment</h2>
  
- We'll be using hardhat to deploy

   - Copy and Paste in your terminal

```bash
cd $HOME && mkdir ethernity-contract && cd ethernity-contract && wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillzyDollarrzz/EthernityChain/refs/heads/main/ethernity-contract.sh && chmod +x ethernity-contract.sh && ./ethernity-contract.sh
```

Note: When you're in `Creating A HardHad Project` Section, 

- Select `Create A TypeScript Project`
